# ðŸŽµ Vibelens: Image-based Music Recommendation

Vibelens is an AI-powered system that recommends the most relevant segment of a song based on an uploaded image. Leveraging the latest in computer vision, large language models, and music content analysis, Vibelens transforms visual emotion into musical resonance.

---

## ðŸ“„ Brief Description

**Vibelens** allows users to upload an image and receive a curated snippet of a song that emotionally or thematically matches the content of that image. This is not just about recommending an entire song â€” we identify the *exact part* (e.g., chorus, bridge, verse) of the song that best matches the mood, setting, or context of the uploaded image. The project integrates image captioning (im2txt), vector search, and song lyric analysis to achieve this level of precision.

## ðŸŽ¯ Functional & Non-functional Requirements

### âœ… Functional Requirements

- User uploads an image through the frontend interface.
- Image is captioned via `im2txt` to extract semantic meaning.
- Captions are embedded and stored in **Pinecone** for similarity search.
- Lyrics of songs are scraped and embedded using the same method.
- The system retrieves the most semantically aligned song *segment*.
- Users are shown a player with the highlighted part of the song.

### ðŸš« Non-functional Requirements

- Scalable backend (using Celery, Redis, PostgreSQL).
- Near real-time response time (under 3 seconds for recommendation).
- Maintainability: Modular design with isolated crawling, captioning, and recommendation services.
- Observability and monitoring with logging and retries via Celery.
- Educational use of Kafka for simulating a streaming pipeline.
